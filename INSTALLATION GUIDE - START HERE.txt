-  INSTALLING FLAWOL-RTX  -
===========================

Welcome to the guide of installing Flawol-RTX, I won't waste your time, here's how to install it into your Portal RTX copy:

STEP 1
- Locate your Portal RTX copy, this should be in:
Steam/steamapps/common/PortalRTX

STEP 2
- Open the 'lss' folder in the 'PortalRTX' folder, then open 'gameReadyAssets', this is where RTX Remix stores the assets for Portal RTX.

STEP 3
- Now open a second window for Flawol-RTX's folders, to understand where to replace certain things, here's what to do:

===================

REPLACING TEXTURES
- Open 'SubUSDs', then 'textures'.
- Copy the Flawol-RTX textures that you'd wish to install, then paste them into the 'textures' folder, perform the replacements.

===================

REPLACING MODELS
- Open 'SubUSDs', all the model .USDs are located here.
- Copy the Flawol-RTX models you'd wish to install, then paste them into the 'SubUSDs' folder, perform the replacements.

===================

REPLACING THE LIGHTS

WARNING: THIS IS HEAVILY EXPERIMENTAL.
DUE TO RTX REMIX'S CURRENT LIMITATIONS, INSTALLING THESE LIGHT CHANGES WILL CAUSE UNEXPECTED LOOKS IN CERTAIN AREAS.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

- Have the 'gameReadyAssets' folder open.
- Copy everything in the Light Changes folder and paste.
- Override, all the formatting in in the Light Changes folder should match exactly with 'gameReadyAssets'.

===================

TO UNINSTALL:

STEP 1
- Open Steam, and navigate to Portal RTX's app properties.

STEP 2
- Go to the 'LOCAL FILES' section, and press 'Verify Integrity of Game Files'.

This will uninstall everything replaced in the Portal RTX files.
