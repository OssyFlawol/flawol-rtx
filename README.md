# flawol-rtx

Flawol-RTX is an experimental Visual Tweaks mod for Portal RTX that aims to restore part of Portal's original identity within Portal RTX, made from resources created for Portal RTX itself. This mod is incredibly experimental due to the fact that modding Portal RTX is incredibly difficult with the lack of any proper tools made for modding RTX Remix produced software. This means that this mod is not able to achieve it's full goals in RTX Remix's current state.

__FAQ__
---------------------------

__HOW DO I INSTALL IT?__

There will be an installation guide found within the download itself, as there is a lot to explain, TL;DR is that this requires replacing Portal RTX assets outright, and you can choose what exactly you want to replace.

---------------------------
__HOW DO I UNINSTALL IT?__

Verify the integrity of your Portal RTX files and Steam will detect the changed files, it will retrieve the original assets and revert your Portal RTX copy back to normal.

---------------------------
__CAN I USE THESE ASSETS IN MY OWN PROJECTS?__

You can use anything I've created so long as you provide credit and it isn't used in a commercial product. However, I do not know NVIDIA's stance on their asswets, so I would personally shy away from it.

---------------------------
__IT SUCKS!__

Good news pal. Flawol-RTX is free and optional, if you don't like Flawol-RTX, just play normal Portal RTX. ;)
